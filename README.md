# Unreal Engine Signature Check Bypasser

A hook to bypass the signature check function in Unreal Engine-based games, enabling modding and custom pak/utoc/ucas loading for the games that uses *.sig files (or encryption) to verify the archives.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the Release section.
2. Extract the zip on the [Releases](https://github.com/rm-NoobInCoding/UniversalSigBypasser/releases) page into your game's Win64 directory (usually found in the `[Project_Name]/Binaries/Win64` path).


> [!TIP]
> I used dsound.dll to load the bypasser dll. You can use any other asi loader you want instead of dsound, just remove the dsound.dll and grab a x64 asi loader from [here](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases) then paste it in the same folder as bypasser.
